# Welcome
I am actively seeking a backend engineering role with a software company focused on building reliable, secure, and robust software. I specialize in Rust and Python and can quickly adapt to new programming languages.

## About me
I am a passionate software engineer with a keen interest in designing, building, and deploying efficient, secure, safe, and reliable software.

Check out [this list](https://github.com/morukele/Books) of books I plan to read or have already read. If you have any book suggestions, you can create a pull request.

- How to reach me: orukele.dev@gmail.com
- Languages: Python üêç, Rust ü¶Ä, C++, and JavaScript üìú
- Open to work opportunities, particularly on Rust projects.

## Open source work:
- Author and Core Maintainer of [paystack-rs](https://github.com/morukele/paystack-rs). [Paystack](https://paystack.com) enables modern online and offline payments for Africa by helping African merchants receive payments from anyone worldwide.

## Important Side Projects
- [ogheneOS](https://github.com/morukele/ogheneOS): a bare-bones operating system built in Rust to learn how operating systems work.
- [r-lox](https://github.com/morukele/r-lox): a Rust based interpreter for the lox programming language, aimed at learning how compliers and interpreters work.
